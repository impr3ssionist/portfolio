    "I'm a software developer and educator living at 9200 feet in the Colorado Rockies. I spend my days solving problems and building web applications, from back-end programming (PostgreSQL, Express.js, Python) to front-end engineering (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js). My focus is on requirement analysis, design, and usability. Recently, I earned my AWS Cloud Practitioner Certification and have been diving into Infrastructure as Code (IaC), serverless technologies, and solutions architecting.",
    "Iâ€™m passionate about web development and data analysis in all its forms, and solving problems for everyday living. Aside from web development, I enjoy spending my time with my partner and friends, climbing mountains, and watching the Seattle Mariners win baseball games.",
